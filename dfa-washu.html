            <h1>Design for America, WashU</h1>
            <p>I haven been involved in DFA since my first semester freshman year, and I have been an executive board (Blueprint) member since my second semester. Through my roles as President, Director of Design Outreach, Director of Communications, Team Mentor, and project teammember, I have developed my own leadership skills, dramatically shaped studio structure and culture, and realized that the design-thinking process can be used not only on community projects, but also on organizational experiences.</p>
            <p>Check out examples of my organizational design thinking below. If you are interested in my project work, check out <a href="http://kellywisneski.com/cubic">Cubic</a> and <a href="http://kellywisneski.com/snap-pack">Snap Pack</a>.</p>

              <p style="font-size:18px; padding-top: 15px;">The first step in solving the challenges the studio faced was developing a culture of feedback to identify issues. Over the years, we have iterated through several techniques that allow us to collect feedback from Blueprint and studio members, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Blueprint Strategic Planning Retreats</li>
                <li>1-on-1 semesterly feedback conversations for Blueprint and studio members</li>
                <li>whole studio facilitated discussions</li>
                <li>sorting exercises</li>
                <li>printed surveys</li>

          <p>Prior to Spring 2015, the WashU DFA studio was predominantly made up of students in design-focused majors, specifically architecture and communication design. I created two recruitment campaigns over my tenure as Director of Communication that promoted design as "problem solving" instead of traditional forms of visual design. My campaigns resulted in a studio membership made up of more than 50% non-design majors, along with greater ethnic and socioeconomic diversity as well.</p>
